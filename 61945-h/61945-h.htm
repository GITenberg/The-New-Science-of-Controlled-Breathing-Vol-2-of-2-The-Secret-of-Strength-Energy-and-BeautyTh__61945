<i>LESSON II</i><br />

Controlled Breathing as a Means of
Exercise</h2></div>


<p>Many theories concerning the art of
breathing have been exploited in recent
years. Numerous books dealing with the
subject have been offered to the public.
The net results, however, have been unsatisfactory.
The appeal of this propaganda
has met with comparatively little
response. The truth as to the importance
of right method in breathing
may have been presented, but it has remained
valueless, since it has not been
accepted and acted upon by those to
whom it was addressed. Perhaps in
great measure the fault lies in the fact
that the various advocates of breath-systems
have been too vague in their
teachings, have expounded the theory
rather than the practice.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I have been
at pains to describe all necessary exercises
in such detail as to make the practice
of them simple and easy for every
reader, I have arranged them in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
order as to make sure a rapid progress
toward perfect breath-control, with its
consequent increase in health, beauty,
efficiency and happiness.</p>

<p>It seems, indeed, difficult to impress
on anybody not familiar with the wonderful
advantages of correct breathing,
a full recognition of the vital bearing
breath-control has on the well-being of
the individual. Air is too ridiculously
cheap to be much respected by most persons.
And, too, breathing is ordinarily
automatic, requiring no thought. Naturally
enough, then, most persons give
it no attention, since they have no realization
of its importance.</p>

<p>Nature has provided that all great
things should be essentially simple. It
is thus with the process of breathing,
which is the chief vital functioning of
the body.</p>

<p>An ancient philosopher has said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The more we desire to have that
which is superfluous, the more we meet
with difficulties; the more necessary the
thing is for living beings, the more
easily it is found and the cheaper it is:
air, water and food are indispensable
to man. Air is most necessary, for if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
man is without air a few moments he
dies, whilst he can be without water a
day or longer. Air is undoubtedly found
more easily and is cheaper than water.
Water is more necessary than food, and
is proportionately cheaper; and so on, as
to the different kinds of food and luxuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Note well the undeniable fact as asserted
by the philosopher, that air is of
the first importance.</p>

<p>If air had to be paid for, or if only a
very limited amount were to be distributed
to each consumer, there would be
an instant and universal recognition of
its supreme value. Its restriction would
compel every individual to appreciate
the unique worth of the true Elixir of
Life.</p>


<h3>What Mortality Statistics Teach Us</h3>

<p>According to statistics of the United
States census, the annual death rate
from all causes is one million. Of this
number, four hundred thousand died
from diseases of the lungs. The figures
demonstrate that two persons, at least
out of every five, come to their death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
prematurely&mdash;and from a preventable
cause.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the truth is gaining
wider recognition day by day throughout
the civilized world. This has to do
with the appreciation of fresh air as a
fundamental of health. There has been
a remarkable awakening to this effect
within a generation. Today, the preferred
treatment of consumptives demands
that they shall live out of doors
if possible; the windows in the hospitals
are seldom closed; sleeping porches are
built wherever space permits.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately true, however, that
there has been little advancement in
general knowledge as to the science, the
art, and practice of correct breathing.
Yet, I have been surprised and gratified
by the eager attention of those friends
to whom I have made explanations and
given exhibitions during the last few
years. Without an exception, these
friends have manifested a keen desire
to learn the secrets of breath-control and
to win for themselves the benefits thus
conferred.</p>

<p>In order to broaden my knowledge
and to render it exact, I have made serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
studies and experiments through a
term of years. I am convinced that if,
instead of gymnasiums, institutions
were established for training in the development
of breath-control, the grim
death-toll of one million for one year in
our country would dwindle amazingly.</p>


<h3>The Gymnastics of Breathing</h3>

<p>You must always remember that the
correct carriage of the body during the
period of the breathing exercises is a
factor of great importance, since the
lungs function variously in accordance
with different postures of the body.</p>

<p>After the fundamental principles of
deep breathing are mastered, the next
step is to connect it with different exercises,
respectively, of the arms, the legs,
the trunk, and the head. At first it will
be found somewhat difficult to combine
attention to the various parts concerned,
but the ability to do this will be readily
mastered by practice.</p>

<p>The point involved is that the muscles
of the chest have a reflex action on other
muscles. For instance, when the lungs
are full of air all the cells are inflated to
the utmost, the chest is stretched, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
diaphragm is drawn down. The various
muscles of the chest, of the back and of
the abdomen are in a state of high tension.
This tension should last only during
the time in which the breath is held.
Moreover, care must be taken that it
shall not influence any other muscles besides
those directly concerned.</p>

<p>When you exercise the arms rhythmically
while the breath is being held,
such movement of the arms must not be
permitted to influence the breath. The
result to be striven for is an intelligent
control of the muscles, so that the various
groups shall be made to act independently.
Every school of gymnastics
seeks to attain the same end&mdash;with a
difference: In this system of breath-control,
the lungs are trained&mdash;the chief
requisite for all health, beauty and
vigor.</p>

<p>And now that we have given this
much of attention to the &#8220;Why?&#8221; let us
go forward to the &#8220;How?&#8221; of breath-control.</p>


<h3>Preparation for the Exercises</h3>

<p>The clothing should be loose, especially
around the neck and chest. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
advisable, when convenient, that the collar
should be removed for the duration
of the exercises. The buttons of the
coat and vest, too, should be unfastened.
(After a short time it will be found that
these buttons must be placed nearer the
edges of the garments.)</p>

<p>The girl or woman who wishes to get
the best results from these exercises
should be sure to have no clothing on
that may bind her about the waist, constrict
her diaphragm, or press upon her
abdominal muscles.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to say that
she should never attempt her exercises
without, at least, first divesting herself
of her corset&mdash;if she wears corsets. It
is better to wear merely the comfortable
union suit that so many sensible girls and
women now wear. For this affords perfect
freedom of movement and permits
every muscle to be properly tensed and
relaxed by the deep breathing exercises,
and the gymnastic movements that accompany
them.</p>

<p>The first requirement throughout all
the exercises is a preliminary releasing
from the lungs of the old, dead air,
which is a continual source of self-poisoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
This accumulation must be
driven out from the points of the lungs
before the new breath is taken. It is
repeated also on the conclusion of all
the exercises. It must never be neglected.</p>


<h3>The Cleansing Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation In Detail</span></p>

<p>This exercise prefaces and ends every
exercise in breathing. By prefacing an
exercise, it makes space in the lungs for
a capacity volume of new breath; by
ending an exercise, it serves the important
function of relaxing the whole
body. It should be studied very carefully.</p>

<p>Exhale (blow out) energetically, saying
&#8220;ss&#8221; between the teeth. Exaggerate
the hissing sound of &#8220;s&#8221;. This protects the
throat. While doing this, bring shoulders
and head forward as in Photograph
1 (a). This helps to press out that air
which is never entirely removed from
the lungs. We call this the residual air.</p>

<p>After exhaling all you can, begin the
second part of this exercise by doing the
opposite. Inhale slowly through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
nose, gradually bringing the out-stretched
arms overhead, performing a
circle; also bring head and shoulders
back, filling the lungs in all parts to
great capacity. See Photograph 1 (b).
Pause for one or two seconds, and relax
suddenly. This is difficult to do correctly.
To relax suddenly means to relax
with a crash&mdash;the breath escapes at
once, the arms fall, the knees bend and
all this must take place together. With
well-opened mouth you say &#8220;Ha!&#8221; to
help make the breath escape quickly.</p>

<p>This very important sudden relaxation
may lack snap and precision at first,
but after a few days the mind will become
trained to its action. After this
relaxation take two shorter breaths in
the same way then pause before repeating.</p>


<h3>The Cleansing Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Condensed Form</span></p>

<p>Position: Erect, with arms at side.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(a) Exhale (blow out) quickly, saying
&#8220;ss.&#8221; See Photograph 1 (a).</p>

<p>(b) Inhale through nose, lifting arms to
front.</p>

<p>(c) Hold breath as in position, Photograph
1 (b).</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>(d) Exhale suddenly &#8220;Ha,&#8221; bringing arms
down to sides.</p>

<p>(e) Two short cleansing breaths. Pause
ten seconds before repeating.</p></div></div>

<p>Ordinarily, do this exercise six to
eight times, with pauses between.</p>


<h3>The Short Controlled Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation In Detail</span></p>

<p>Exhale first as shown in Photograph 1
(the cleansing breath). This precedes
every exercise.</p>

<p>After the cleansing breath, inhale
through the nose, while placing the
hands lightly on hips, as in Photograph
2. Hold the breath a few seconds and
open the mouth. Do not permit any
breath to escape. The opening of the
mouth proves to yourself that there is
no contraction at the throat; instead,
the diaphragm is holding the breath.
Now, exhale, saying &#8220;ss&#8221; between the
teeth, with relaxed throat. It is very
important to observe that the chest is
held high for the first half of expiration.
Then let it quickly sink with the breath,
and take two or three quick cleansing
breaths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Observe that the shoulders do not rise
while inhaling&mdash;that you really inhale,
not that you stretch the chest muscles
and lift the shoulders, as I have seen
even athletes do, when asked to take a
deep breath. Besides opening the mouth
during the period of held breath, it
would be well to turn the neck several
times to prove its freedom from tension.</p>


<h3>The Short Controlled Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Condensed Form</span></p>

<p>Position: Erect, with arms at sides.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(a) Exhale as in Exercise One, saying
&#8220;ss.&#8221;</p>

<p>(b) Inhale through nose, placing hands
on hips as in Photograph 2.</p>

<p>(c) Hold breath one to four seconds;
open mouth.</p>

<p>(d) Exhale &#8220;ss&#8221; first holding chest high,
then letting it sink slowly with
breath.</p>

<p>(e) Two to three cleansing breaths. Pause
before repeating.</p></div></div>

<p>To be done five or six times with
pauses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Climax Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation In Detail</span></p>

<p>This exercise is the most difficult of
all breathing gymnastics, and should not
be attempted by the sick. It requires
great endurance. Even an athlete
should not attempt it, until the others
are well in hand.</p>

<p>The first part is exactly like the exercise
marked &#8220;The Short Controlled
Breath.&#8221; But in the second part, instead
of expelling the air suddenly, you proceed
to exhale very slowly (after holding
the breath a few seconds). Care
should be taken to see that the upper
chest is held high as long as possible
while exhaling. With the last atom of
breath leaving the lungs, drop (relax)
the shoulders and whole frame. Quickly take
two or three more cleansing
breaths to quiet the heart and lungs.</p>

<p>When one is ready for this strenuous
exercise, it becomes a great force for
building breadth and depth to the chest,
and new inner vitality.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks one performance
of this exercise is enough for the
day. After the second month, two exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
per day, fifth month, three exercises
per day, etc., very gradually increasing
the number.</p>


<h3>The Climax Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Condensed Form</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(a) Exhale &#8220;ss.&#8221;</p>

<p>(b) Inhale slowly. &#8220;Hiss&#8221; through smallest
opening of lips and closed teeth.
Place hands on diaphragm, as in Photograph
3.</p>

<p>(c) Hold breath several seconds.</p>

<p>(d) Exhale slowly &#8220;ss&#8221; through small
opening of lips and teeth.</p>

<p>(e) Several cleaning breaths. <b>Long</b> pause.</p></div></div>

<p>This is never to be performed more than
twice at one time, during the first two
months.</p>

<p>With girls or women who are inclined
to stoutness, it may sometimes be well
to place the hands immediately under
the busts&mdash;slightly supporting the
breasts&mdash;instead of on the hips.</p>

<p>It will be found that the &#8220;relaxing&#8221;
movements can thus be performed with
more comfort&mdash;until such time as the
muscles supporting the busts gain in
strength and elasticity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Care should be taken at first not to
take in too much breath, nor to hold the
breath too long. This matter, however,
is entirely individual. Naturally, a
greater amount of care must be exercised
by a delicate child or by a consumptive
than by a healthy youth.</p>

<p>And right here it should be emphasized
that, if you are a business man,
sitting for long hours every day at a
desk, you should, in order to derive the
maximum amount of good from these
breathing exercises, plan to stand up,
near the open window and spend a few
minutes practicing some of these simple
exercises.</p>

<p>You will often find that what you
thought was the fatigue of overwork is
nothing more or less than staying too
long in a close atmosphere, and making
an insufficient use of your organs of respiration.</p>

<p>The feeling of freshness these exercises
will impart, the increased vigor and
the enhanced clearness of mind that will
come to you, will prove a grateful source
of surprise.</p>

<p>Many men, formerly in the habit of
visiting for a cocktail, take a few deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
breaths in this scientific manner. They
claim that this Fresh Air Cocktail is better
than any coffee or liquor stimulant.
And it can be certain that nothing but
good effects can ever follow it.</p>

<p>By this system of breathing you can
build up a wonderful physique. You can
become strong and active, and have a
superabundance of health and vitality&mdash;and
without spending more than a few
minutes a day at your breathing exercises.
After a short time the <i>habit</i> for
slow, deep breathing is formed, and as
with all habits, it requires no attention
whatsoever.</p>


<h3>Hints for Controlled Breathing</h3>

<p>It should go almost without saying
that to get the <i>best</i> effects from air you
should breathe the purest air obtainable.</p>

<p>Air which is full of dust particles, for
instance, may be actually irritating to
the delicate mucous membrane that lines
the nose, throat, bronchial tubes and air
cells of the lungs.</p>

<p>This dust contains particles of organic
matter derived from the excrement of
horses and dogs, from dried atoms of offal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and decaying vegetable matter, or
from dried mud impregnated with urine.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is very largely upon these
particles that the micro-organisms&mdash;arch
enemies of mankind as well as of
animal kind&mdash;are carried on their errand
of destruction.</p>

<p>These micro-organisms are most
abundant in the air of inhabited rooms&mdash;and
the more people in the room the
greater the number of microbes present.</p>

<p>So don&#8217;t be afraid of open windows&mdash;day
or night. Remember Florence
Nightingale&#8217;s quaint observation, &#8220;Windows
are made to be opened.&#8221;</p>


<h3>Always Breathe Through the Nose</h3>

<p>It should be remembered, also, that so
far as possible, all inhalation of air
should be through the nose. This is for
two very important reasons.</p>

<p>First, the fine hairs lining the nasal
passages act as a sieve through which
the inspired air is strained.</p>

<p>Further than this the lower turbinated
bodies in the nose, and the lower half of
the middle turbinates are covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tiny cells (ciliated tissue) protruding
from the membrane covering of the turbinates.</p>

<p>These cells catch and hold any particles
of dust or other matter that may
have slipped through the hair screen of
the nostrils. Thus dust, germs and
other harmful material are removed
from the air currents, and prevented
from reaching the lung cells.</p>

<p>The next most important reason is
that the chambers of the nose, with
their wonderfully rich blood supply, act
as temperature regulators.</p>

<p>If you breathe air at zero temperature
through the nose it is actually warmed
to body temperature before it passes into
the bronchial tubes.</p>

<p>If you were to breathe desert air, or
the air of a blast furnace heated to 130
degrees&mdash;this superheated air would be
cooled approximately to body temperature
before it was passed into the lung
cells.</p>

<p>If there is a tendency to breathe
through the mouth, this will be manifested
most decidedly at night, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
you are asleep, and the muscles are relaxed.</p>

<p>If you find that you are in the habit
of sleeping with the mouth open&mdash;awakening
in the morning with a dry, harsh
throat, it might be well to adopt the device
which Dr. William H. Fitzgerald
introduced to the medical profession almost
20 years ago.</p>

<p>This consists merely in applying a
small piece of surgeon&#8217;s adhesive plaster
over the closed lips, keeping them closed
during all the hours of the night.</p>

<p>The court-plaster can be applied
lengthwise over the lips; or it can be
pasted across the lips, holding them
firmly in the closed position. Many find
the latter method the most practical.</p>

<p>The more fresh air you can get in your
home, your office or school or workshop,
or wherever you may have to spend your
day time&mdash;the better off you&#8217;ll be.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
